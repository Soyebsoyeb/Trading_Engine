Trading Engine
A high-performance, multi-threaded trading engine simulation written in C++ that demonstrates order matching, market data processing, and real-time metrics tracking.

📋 Overview
This trading engine simulates a financial exchange with multiple producers generating buy/sell orders, a thread-safe order queue, and matching engine workers that process orders in batches. The system includes comprehensive metrics collection, latency tracking, and real-time trade logging.

✨ Key Features
Multi-threaded Architecture: Separate producer, consumer, and metrics threads

Batch Processing: Configurable batch sizes for optimal performance

Thread-safe Order Queue: Lock-based queue with condition variables

Order Matching Engine: Price-time priority matching algorithm

Real-time Metrics: Latency tracking, volume statistics, and trade logging

Configurable Parameters: Tunable for different performance characteristics

🛠️ Problems Solved & Solutions
1. Thread Synchronization & Data Races
Problem: Multiple threads accessing shared data (order queue, order book) simultaneously causing race conditions.

Solution:

cpp
class OrderQueue {
    queue<Order> q;
    mutex mtx;
    condition_variable cv;
    atomic<size_t> size_{0};
    // Uses mutex + condition_variable for thread-safe operations
};
2. Producer-Consumer Coordination
Problem: Efficiently handling variable rate of order production vs consumption without busy waiting.

Solution:

cpp
size_t pop_batch(vector<Order> &dest, size_t max_items, atomic<bool> &done) {
    unique_lock<mutex> lock(mtx);
    cv.wait_for(lock, chrono::milliseconds(50), [&]{ 
        return !q.empty() || done.load(); 
    });
    // Batch processing with timeout
}
3. Order Matching Logic
Problem: Implementing fair price-time priority matching while maintaining thread safety.

Solution:

cpp
void matchOrders() {
    lock_guard<mutex> lock(ob_mtx);
    
    // Sort by price-time priority
    sort(buys.begin(), buys.end(), buy_cmp);  // Higher price first
    sort(sells.begin(), sells.end(), sell_cmp); // Lower price first
    
    // Cross orders when buy >= sell price
    while(!buys.empty() && !sells.empty() && 
          buys.front().price >= sells.front().price) {
        // Execute trade
    }
}
4. Performance Under Load
Problem: Maintaining low latency with high order volumes.

Solution:

Batch Processing: Process multiple orders per lock acquisition

Atomic Counters: Use atomic variables for frequent counter updates

Efficient Locking: Fine-grained locking for different components

5. Memory Management
Problem: Unbounded growth of trade logs and order books.

Solution:

cpp
// Limited trade log to prevent memory exhaustion
deque<string> tradeLog;
size_t tradeLogLimit = 2000;
if(tradeLog.size() > tradeLogLimit) tradeLog.pop_front();
6. Graceful Shutdown
Problem: Cleanly stopping all threads during interruption.

Solution:

cpp
atomic<bool> globalStop{false};
void handle_sigint(int) {
    globalStop.store(true);
}

// Threads periodically check stopFlag
while(!stopFlag.load()) {
    // Process work
}

🚀 Usage
bash
# Compile
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread -O2 trading_engine.cpp -o trading_engine

# Run with default parameters
./trading_engine

# Run with custom parameters
./trading_engine <num_producers> <orders_per_producer> <producer_delay_us> <engine_threads> <batch_size>

# Example: High-throughput configuration
./trading_engine 4 10000 10 4 32
⚙️ Configuration Parameters
Parameter	Description	Default
num_producers	Number of order producer threads	2
orders_per_producer	Orders generated per producer	5000
producer_delay_us	Microseconds between orders (0 = burst mode)	20
engine_threads	Number of matching engine threads	2
batch_size	Orders processed per batch	16
📊 Metrics Output
The system provides real-time metrics including:

Elapsed time

Total trades executed

Buy/sell volumes

Queue size and book depth

Average queue latency

Recent trade history

⚡ Performance Considerations
Batch Size: Larger batches reduce locking overhead but increase latency

Thread Count: Balance between CPU cores and context switching overhead

Producer Delay: Controls order rate and system load

Queue Timeout: Balances responsiveness vs CPU usage

🔮 Limitations & Future Enhancements
Currently uses simple price-time matching

No persistence (in-memory only)

Basic order types (market orders only)

No network interface (simulated data)

📝 Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates core trading engine concepts with production-quality thread synchronization and performance monitoring, providing a solid foundation for building more sophisticated trading systems.
